                    <p>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on February 5, 1985, in Funchal, Madeira, Portugal.
                        Growing up in a working-class neighborhood, Ronaldo faced several challenges but was determined
                        to
                        pursue his passion for football. From a young age, he displayed an exceptional talent for the
                        sport,
                        which was nurtured by his father, who worked as a kit man at a local football club. At the age
                        of
                        12, Ronaldo moved to Lisbon to join Sporting CP's youth academy, leaving his family behind. This
                        move marked the beginning of his journey to becoming a professional footballer, as he quickly
                        rose
                        through the ranks with his incredible speed, technique, and goal-scoring ability.
